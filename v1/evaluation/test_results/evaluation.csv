","Communication Summary: 
Observations
Although written in a pleasing style, the briefing document would have benefitted from a clearer structure. 
E.g., introduction & background/ main issues /options for the way forward & recommendations/ conclusion. 

The candidate has successfully identified the main areas of concern and offered some recommendations. But some of the information towards the end of the document would have worked better in the introduction/background section where it could have provided better context.

The issue with DG AGRI should have been flagged immediately and expanded upon.

The candidate has made an effort to explain the low, medium and high ambition options that the legislative proposal is based on, as well as the main issues involved. Perhaps these issues could have been listed in a clearer way. 
E.g.:
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

Overall, the main issues section needs to be expanded to detail the support from other DGs, as well as the concern and viewpoints of DG AGRI and DG SANTE.

The candidate has done a good job in summarizing some key issues in relation to space requirement concerns and that farmers would need to be compensated. The risk of unfair competition from third countries is mentioned but not fully explored.

Would also have been useful to touch on the following points:

E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

In the recommendations section, there are some good suggestions made. But overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of the briefing. Fully expand on the reasoning behind taking different options.

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI. 

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Provide a conclusion that summarizes your recommendations as well as briefly explaining why this is the best course of action. 

Provide a fall-back option if there is one available.

Date: 1 June 202X
To: Ms Heinrich (Director General of DG SANTE)
Subject: Animal welfare legislative proposal 
Main issues at stake (remaining problems)
- To address the specific objective of the animal welfare legislation revision, we have 4 policy measures with different ambition options (low, medium, high): 1) Pigs 2) Calves 3) Laying hens and pullets 4) Rabbits and fur-producing animals. The general transition period: 5-12 years depending on the level of the ambition (please see the table attached)
- For the banning of i) the killing of day-old male chicks and ii) paintful mutilations we should consider a ten years' transition period. 
Reccommendations
- we need to make sure to have similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements for products of animal origin imported to the EU
- the pressure over production costs due to a competitive global market for the farmers and all food business operators led to further intensification of the killing practices, and to a replacement of small farms by very large industrial scale installations
- we need to consider technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations
- we ned to have harmonised EU rules in order to stop MSs to adopt different national measures that jeropardise the legal landscape also for animal welfare labelling.
- the policy option to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years. The same requirment should be applied for eggs and egg products imported to the EU form 3rd countries.
- as suggested by DG AGRI a compensation mechnism for farmers should be taken into consideratino to avoid the increase of the price for consumers.
- we should take into consideration also the recommendation of the EFSA concerning the livestock density that should be reduced: free range layer birds with more interactions with each other can lead to an increased incidence of infectious poultry disease
Backgorund information
- After an European citizen's initiative ""End the cage Age"" and an own initiative resolution of the EUropean Parliament recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture, the Commission is revising the Animal welfare Regulation. 
- We launched an inter-service consultation on the review of the the animal welfare Regulation, we got green light by all DGs except DG AGRI."

Briefing on driveless cars
Today is 16 November 20XX
 
Introduction-Background information
Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility and will create challenges. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. It has also the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. However, automated vehicle technologies require an effective regulatory and legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.
1. Potentials and challenges of vehicle automation
The potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles has several aspects with technical, financial, economic, legal and ethical dimensions. 
Driverless cars will reform transportation as we know it by improoving our lives. Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. It will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars don’t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. 
Eliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set.The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels. With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.
From economic aspect, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical while workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes.
Innovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents—a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20
At the same time policy makers, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.
The rapid development of robots/automated cars might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs for example the replacement of corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees will push up the unemployment. 
Last but not least, the growing use of robotics  raises ethical issues concerning privacy and safety. The new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system? A possible solution could be a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.
2. The different levels of automation and their deployment
But, what does ""autonomous driving"" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving.The levels are six (0-5).
Level 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.
Level 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. However, the driver has to operate the accelerator and the brake having the control of the car at all times.
Level 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.
Level 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.
Level 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.
Level 5 – The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.
 
3. Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play
Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.
One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. The amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.
The regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. Regulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.
EU Commission should be ready to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. As regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.
Traffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident. Relevant legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. A mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated is needed. In addition, a specific legal status for robots in the long run, should be established in order to identify who is liable if they cause damage.
Regarding ethics the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise should be considered.
4.  Ongoing work in the EU
In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved — the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.
Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.
The debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.
The EP resently (16-03-20xx) voted a resolution for the establishment of EU legislation for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars. In addition, the European Commission promised dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus. The first step in a roadmap, was published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy last May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10."

Briefing Note on the draft revised animal welfare regulation, version 1 June 202X
Introduction - In April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out the use of animal cages, with a view to eventually prohibit them. This echoes growing concerns among the European population for what regards animal welfare. This Note aims to provide an analysis of the situation, the reasoning behind the proposed regulation and its potential benefits. 
Main argument - The proposed regulation will enhance animal welfare by introducing a system whereby the use of animal cages will be gradually phased out. This will also serve the purpose of providing an answer to growing concerns among the European population for the welfare of animals, which -as is widely documented- is an important topic for many citizens. However, there are significant challenges to this initiative. The changes that will need to be implemented if the new piece of legislation is adopted will pose several significant challenges:
- costs incurred by farmers to comply with new standards can be seen as disproportionate
- higher food prices will negatively impact the poorest families
The Directorate General is well aware of the importance of the policy objectives and the need to mitigate its negative consequences for both producers and consumers. On the long-run, the long-term sustainability of our agricultural sector will be enhanced.
Conclusion - By proposing this new piece of legislation, the Commission aims to strike a balance between agricultural productivity and and the long term well-being of our agricultural sector."

Observations
Generally, this is a very good attempt to present a complex issue.
The introductory paragraph conveys relevant background information regarding the topic. However, the written style needs work in terms of professional fluency, and there are grammar issues that need to be ironed out. 

Also, I’m not entirely clear on the focus of the briefing from this introduction, as the disagreement of DG AGRI should be flagged from the outset. 

In the policy objective section, the key issues are set out clearly in bullet points.  However, from I. Main Issues, the briefing gives the impression of being a work-in-progress, due to its overreliance on writing in note form. Because of this, the text seems slightly disjointed and there is a lack of coherence at times. 
Furthermore, some points are not elaborated on further, analysed for their significance, or more completely argued. 
Some key details and relevant information is omitted or generalized. Providing more specifics and data on key issues will give a more comprehensive overview of the situation and lead to more informed reasoning regarding the solutions going forward. 
E.g.:
-  Could have mentioned that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so briefly mention what these options mean.

The suggestions given are commendable, but these need to be clearer, with recommendations given with solid reasoning as well as an exploration of consequences.

Some further grammar issues and several typos impact the readability of the document.
","KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- The trainee's answer lacks clarity and conciseness. The sentences are often overly complicated and unclear, making it difficult for the reader to understand the main points.
- The trainee does not tailor the message to the needs of the Director-General. The answer does not address the specific issues and options outlined in the case study, and it does not present the information in a clear and structured manner.
- The trainee's arguments and reasoning are weak. They do not effectively convey the key points and fail to address the concerns raised by DG AGRI.

Briefing note
1st of June 202X
For the attention of Ms Heinrich, Director-General
Subject: Animal welfare legislative proposal
Reference: Impact assessment report on Animal welfare: revised regulation of 13 October 202X-1
Background:
Last year, the European Comission has prepared an working document of Animal welfare regulation. This year, there was an inter-service consultation with DG AGRI, DG ENV, DG TRADE on animal welfare regulation, on 16/05/202X. Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets. The pressure to have lower prices on certain foods has led to intensification of farming with negative effect on animal welfare. The purpose of this briefing is to make more clarity towards the decision of which option to choose for the animal welfare regulation.
Policy objectives:
A. Phasing out confining cages
A general transition period needed.
B. Banning the killing of day-old male chiks
In case of a ban, a transition period need to be combined with stricter import rules. 
C. Banning paintfull mutilations
Incentives for voluntary action would enter into force imediatelly. 
D. Annimal welfare requirements at import
Similar or fully equivalent. 
I. Main issues and remaining problems to solve
1. - There is a pressure to reduce production costs, which leads to conditions and equipment they may harm the animals. 
2. - Around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages every year accross Europe. No single EU country is cage free.
3. - Not all the DG agree with the line of the animal welfare regulation. The current legislation is outdated, fragmented and too general. 
4. - Need to choose between ethics and prices. The impact of imposing the animal welfare regulation will lead to increase in prices. For the moment there is a lack of incentives to invest in animal welfare. A partial or total ban on cages would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. 
II. Arguments and facts to ease a decision - the way foreward on animal welfare regulation
DG AGRI does not yet agree with DG SANTE main line on animal welfare regulation. The number of poultry cage need to be determined or incetives to the farmers to ba established.  
Strengths
- we received confirmation from DG ENV that the proposal is in line with the European Green Deal objectives
- increase animal welfare protection
Disadvantages
- the big farmers cannot compete with cage free adoption because they would need more space, as underlines DG AGRI. This will lead to a price increase of 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal and Malta. 
- the European farmers will not be able to compete with third countries producers, who do not take into account animal welfare.
In conclusion
There are 3 types of options: low, medium and high. Medium and high ambition options can be combined with stricter requirements of minimum space per animal and antibiotics to be used. 
a. Following the comments received after the interservice consultation, the low ambition option or status quo should apply for protecting the market and ensure competitive pricing of food products for animal welfare. 
b. As the citizens are putting pressure through an European initiative, a decision on animal welfare should be taken asap. 
c. Regarding the poultry cage rearing, the smaller the farms, easier it is for them to implement cage free rearing.
d. The domino effect will start from animal welfare regulation - higher food prices - burden on poor families. DG AGRI proposal of incentives seem to be a solution. 
Recommendation prefered on animal welfare regulation
In conclusion there is an urge to implement as soon as possible the 'cage free' legislation for animals, accompagned by a cost/efficiency analysis. In parallel to the legislation, in order to facilitate a balanced economy, financial support and incentives may be provided through the new eco-schemes instrument of DG AGRI. Accepting the economic compensations to poultry farming will suggested by DG AGRI, will unblock our proposal on animal welfare regulation. 
The legislation should be more specific and sustanable, in accordance to the European Green Deal Objectives. Last, but not least, awarness -raising of consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level of competition. 
Therefore a mix between medium and high ambition options is preferred."

INTERNAL NOTE (DG Mobility and Transport)
This internal note aims at assisting the press office to prepare a press release announcing the publication, by the Single Europeas Sky Air traffic management Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking, of its blueprint for drone use in low-level air space. The publication of this blueprint, following a request of the Commission, is part of the Commission's Aviation Strategy, which requires an effective legal framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of concerns, notably safety.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States (MS) and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules in order to implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which is expected to be adopted in the coming months.
Within this context, the Commission, through SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.
This note will first highlight the opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace (1) and it will then turn to the blueprint for drone use in low-level air space (2).
1. Opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace
1.1. Opportunities of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace
- Employement and growth:
According to the European Air Safety Agency (EASA), unmanned aircraft has great potential for producing new jobs and growth.
- New or better services:
In its Riga Declaration ""Framing the future of aviation"", the European aviation community further advocates that drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmetal friedly way.
This aspect was also hightlighted in the press, where several potential benefits of drones have been put forward, from Amazon deliveries to rescue missions and fight against crime.
1.2. Threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace:
- Safety:
Some concerns have been raised in the press that ""saferty occurences"" involving drones in Europe are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes. Similar concerns have been raised by the European aviation community, which stated, in its recent Rega Declaration, that, althoigh no one is on board of a drone, people in other aicraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing.
- Noise:
The European aviation community also identified other risks linked to the use of drones, such as nuisances and negatice externalities.
- Right to privacy:
In its recent Riga Declaration, the European aviation community also raised concerns with respect to the protection of fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, as many drones involve data-gathering such as filming.
- Security threats:
Another risk which has been put forward is the potential security risk linked to the malicious use of drones.
It can thus be said that the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace both has a lot of potential to foster European leadership and competitiveness, but also implied important risks that need to be mitigated through an effective legal framework.
2. The blueprint for drone use in low-level air space
The purpose of this blueprint is to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentallu friendly. It will pave the way for the development of a strong and dynamic EU drone services market.
This blueprint oulines the proposed vision for the concept of ""U-space"", which is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace (altitudes of up to 150 meters) for large number of drones.
This paper outiles a number of basic principles:
i) Safety at low level altitude levels:
The concept is to develop a system similar to that of Air Traffic Management (ATM) for manned aviation.
ii) Automated system:
The system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions.
iii) Partly up and running by 20XX+2:
It will be the case for basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing."

Dear Ferdinand
I am back to you with the memo as you have requested. If you have any comment I can modify the memo still today. 
BACKGROUND
The goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives. In fact, the batteries are necessary to boost the production of energy from renewable sources. 
The political agreement at EU level on the battery regulation is an important step. However, lithium, a key batteries material which is at the core of the batteries production cycle, is interested by a series of issues. These issues may compromise the goal of the proposal which aims at safe, sustainble and competitive batteries.
In fact, from the adoption of the regulation by the Commission, the context is changed. Outside the EU, the US may become extremely attractive to establish lithium production cycles on their territory by means of the IRA. Within the EU, the possible upcoming decision of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) about the risk for human health because of certain key lithium salts, may compromise our internal investments on lithium supply and refining. 
MAIN ISSUES
Lithium is a key component of batteries. The global lithium demand will increase enormously in the next decade, and the global offer of lithium might not keep up the speed of the demand. This situation might be particularly critical in the EU where the lithium demand will be higher than in the rest of the world and the lithium mining and production is nonexistent. 
Nowadays, the EU depends on supply and refinement of Lithium from third countries. Opening lithium mines and establishing lithium refinement plants in Europe, as foreseen in the proposal, will reduce the dependency from the third countries.
However, if ECHA will decide to classify some key lithium salts hazardous for human health, its is expected that there will be an increase in the costs for mining and producing lithium in Europe, with potential exodus of investors.
In addition, on the other side of the Athlantic, the IRA makes extremely attractive to base lithium mining and refinement in the US terriotry.
WAY FORWARD
It is necessary to impement new measures in the batteries regulation to prevent troubles for the european market and update the regulation to the new context.
Firstly, regarding the production chain of batteries, we need to align the attractiveness of the EU market to those determined in the US by means of the IRA. Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process. 
Secondly, independently from the ECHA decision, we cannot exclude that in future additional risks for human health will arise in the batteries product chain. Therefore we need to integrate the batteries regulation with a system that values the production chains that respect the EU law in terms of protection of the human health and on the other hand hinders those production chains that do not comply with the requirements for human health established by the EU. 
In the long run, we will be able also to count on lithium recycling and on the use of new technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) and Direct Lithium to production (DLP), and the use of materials alternative to lithium can be explored. However, we need to invest on EU reserach to make these paths much more concrete.
Before our internal meeting, I will reach our collegues in ECHA for an update on the potential ban for certain lithium salts (the decision was expected by the beginning of this year). In case the ECHA will ban key lithiums salts, a revision of the impact assessment for the batteries regulation is desirable, the feasibility of this has to be checked during the internal meeting.
AGENDA
I've kept the agenda very simple and focused on our main issues for the ISC consultations: 
1 - Opening;
2 - The proposal in the new context;
3 - Fine-tuning the proposal:
- the new global context  and attractiveness of the EU market;
- valuing protection of human health in the batteries production chain;
4 - Next steps for the fine-tuning of the proposal;
5 - Closing of the meeting.
I am available to support you on introducing points 3 ad 4 in partiular.  
Looking forward
YOU"

Briefing Note / DG Mobility and Transport
Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. However,automated vehicle technologies require an effective legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.
Potentials and challenges of vehicle automation
Potential benefits of vehicle automation
1. Increased road safety: As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure for drivers and pedestrians alike. A KPMG report predicts an 80% drop in accidents in 20 years.
2. Environmental benefits: Vehicles will be lighter and more fuel efficient which will lead to reduced energy demand. In addition, their used is optimised and they pick up and drop customers constantly without needing to spend energy and time looking for parking (i.e. in peak hours, these vehicles will be used 90% of the time in large cities).
3. Increased affordability of car ownership/sharing: The costs of car ownership are expected to drop by 75%.
4. Accesibility: People with reduced mobility, disability or living in rural areas will have easier access to mobility services.
Challenges and drawbacks
1. Unclear liability in case of accidents: Although reduced, accidents will continue happening and there needs to be a way to ensure that the liabile party is clear and that victims are compensated.
2. Ethical issues: Given the data driven nature of driveless car sharing, some privacy and data safety issues will emerge. The automated systems will also take decisions (e.g. among different options in a car crash scenario) which will need ethical oversight.
3. Job market impacts: The development of the sector might result in the displacement of some jobs and the loss of others. The size of the sector is considerable (e.g. 2% of US total employment).
4. Difficulties adapting to fragmeted road traffic regulation: Europe has different national juristdictions when it comes to road traffic and this can inder the deployment of new technologies for systems or vehicles.
The different levels of automation and their deployment
Levels of Automation
There are different levels of automation ranging from already deployed mechanisms like park assistance or traffic jam assistance to vehicles without a driving wheel.
The US Department of Transportations's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) an dETRAC provide different definitions of 5 levels of automation. All in all, there are 3 stages whose differences will be determinan for regulation and insurance: Automated, Autonomous and Driveress.
Deployment
The first commercial uses of the technology are likely to be driverless trucks first deployed as part of convoys lead by a driven vehicle and then as fully autonomous series of automated trucks. Motorways will be the safets place for CAD test as they are pedestrian free, often straight and uniform across Europe.
Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play
The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic from 1968 (ratified by all EU MS except of Spain) is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and increase road safety by establishing stadard traffic rules among parties. However, Article 8 establishes that the driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. Its amendment still demands that each vehicle must have a driver so the Convention needs to be further amended to adapt to driverless vehicles and clarified as different countries are choosing to interpret Article 8 in different ways.
An EU regulation of the sector could mean that the EC sents the standards for the later international UN treaty, which could take up to 5 years to modify.
Technical requirements for Vehicles are harmonised in the framework of two UNECE agreements (1958 and 1998) where the EU is a contracting party. In addition, Certificates of Conformity, issued by any EU member state, certifying that a vehicle meets all relevant legal requirements, are accepted in all other members.
Regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries and the EU needs to take the lead on setting the standards to avoid having to follow standards set by others.he regulation of the sector will need to overcome the challenges identified including the harmonization of traffic regulations and vehicle requirements but also data processing, liability issues, infrastructure and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) interoperability.
Ongoing work in the EU
The White Paper on the Furture of Europe identifies autonomous vehicles as an areas where the EU can deliver tangible benefits to citizens.
The Commission foresees to publish a Roadmap as part of the EU Transport Strategy on the 31st of May.
National EU leaders signed an agreement in Rome to allow cross-border tests and experiments with autonomous vehicles and to establish a national contact point to approve them.
Suggestions from the European Parliament to develop EU standards for the sector include:
1. Creating a specific legal status for robots to establish who is liable in case of accidents.
2. Making inusrance mandatory and creating a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driveless cars are compensated
3. Creating a European Agency for robotics and artificial intelligence to support public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise in the field.
4. The creation of a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers could ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards while respecting human dignity."
