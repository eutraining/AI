Summary

The text serves as a memorandum detailing the EU's position and challenges with regard to lithium supply chains and their impact on battery production. 
The author touches upon multiple issues like dependency on third countries, possible changes in regulations, and strategic adjustments to stay competitive. 
The thesis statement is that the EU needs to update its regulation to maintain a sustainable, safe, and competitive lithium supply chain in light of new developments.

The text is somewhat well-organized, but there are areas for improvement in clarity and specificity. Some paragraphs are too dense and could be broken down for easier understanding. While evidence to support claims is implied, more statistical data could strengthen the argument. There are multiple grammar and spelling errors

Summary
The short but largely adequate text focuses on the lithium supply chain and its significance in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, specifically for the European Union (EU). 
It discusses the expected surge in lithium demand, the EU's dependency on China, and suggests several strategies that the EU could employ to mitigate these issues. 
The author argues that it is essential for the EU to act promptly to remain competitive in the global market.
For improvement, the author could focus on organizing the text better. While the main points are present, they could be better sequenced for clarity. 
Some statistics are mentioned but not thoroughly backed up; for instance, the ""500% increase by 2030"" could be supported by referencing a study. 
Grammatically, the text is generally well-written but minor errors in spelling and grammar are present.

Unfortunately, this is an unsuccessful case study that contains the basis of a good one, but it needs more elaboration.
First and foremost,  while list format is more than welcome in some cases (e.g. pro/con lists), we expect a coherent, consistent, professional, and easy-flowing text. Make every connection and causation explicit, no matter how obvious they are; thus, you can enhance the cohesion of your text and achieve stronger content points. Merge short, one-sentence paragraphs to improve your case study's narrative arch.
Keep it as simple as you can: use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence.
Keep track of all the information: take notes, for it's better to sort out or merge details while writing than leave out something.
If the source documents provide some insight into the given subject matter’s international aspects, then it is worth discussing it in a few sentences to provide a full picture.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.
It is always great to spend a few sentences on future options, possibilities, or even problems to give an even more professional impression.

The structure of the text is disorganized, and the trainee does not provide clear headings or sections to separate different topics or arguments.

Summary

This is a good case study with some room for improvement in all competencies.
First and foremost, use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence. 
While list format is more than welcome in some cases (e.g. pro/con lists), we expect a coherent, consistent, professional, and easy-flowing text. Make every connection and causation explicit, no matter how obvious they are; thus, you can enhance the cohesion of your text and achieve stronger content points. Merge short, one-sentence paragraphs to improve your case study's narrative arch. 
If the source documents provide some insight into whether the given subject matter has international aspects , then it is worth discussing in a short list or in one or two sentences such possibilities as well, in order to provide a full picture.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.

Summary

This is a great case study that could have achieved an even higher result had there been more attention paid to its linguistic quality.
First and foremost, use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence.

Keep up the good work!

- Good understanding of the topic
- Logical structure and flow of the text

Where I suggest improvement is:

For example, ""Using driverles cars is first money saving"" should be ""Using driverless cars can first save money."" It is important to review the text for these errors and make the necessary corrections.

For example, ""The use of driverless will also be eco-friendly as traffic will be reduced due to more automated car sharing offer and there will be more energy saving with no more use of public lights for instance"" could be rephrased as ""Driverless cars will also contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing traffic congestion and energy consumption, such as the elimination of the need for public lights.""
- Use of abbreviations: While it is good to use abbreviations to save space, it is important to introduce and explain them before using them. For example, ""NHTSA defined the five levels of autonomy"" should be ""The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined the five levels of autonomy.""

The quality, relevance, and conciseness of your arguments were generally good. However, there are some areas where the arguments could be further developed or clarified.
